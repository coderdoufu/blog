My goal is to hold this company for a couple of years and I hope that I could get a better and reasonable price entry. I understand that it\u2019s a growth company and I have several good records of spotting a few good explosive growth companies when their price is still low. However, given that we have a different economic condition, I would rather be more conservative about my entry position for long-term investment.

Tapering means reducing its asset purchase and hence, it will reduce the money supply and ease inflation. For an overvalued stock like Tesla, it will most likely be affected.

Most of our Chinese stocks have shown a better improvement in May. There are a number of reasons behind this. First, China\u2019s crackdown on commodity prices has sent some institutional funds to search for more defensive stocks, such as Alibaba and Xinyi solar. Second, $0968.HK (Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd) and Byd will be added to Hang Seng Index. This undoubtedly improves their visibility to a broader range of investors and the index inclusion effect will also increase their stock rating indirectly. Third, Meituan, one of our largest holdings, has reported excellent financial results. At the same time, CEO Wang Xing has also revealed that the company is working with regulators to make the appropriate changes to its business. This certainly removed some of the investors\u2019 concerns about the antitrust issue. I have also added more positions to JD.com as its current share price presents a larger room for growth before it hits its intrinsic value.")),(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Crytocurrency"),": I have been buying cryptocurrency like $BNB since last year but most of my positions reside in a different account. One of the reasons why our position is down over 5% this month was partly due to crypto positions. We have witnessed the largest drawdown of most of the crypto assets since January. Many analyses have shown that this temporary crash was a healthy correction that wiped out many leveraged positions. Big whales have shown interest in buying more on the dip and this created stronger support for the next big wave up. The technical analysis has saved us from selling at the bottom and helped us build back our crypto positions at a better price level. I do hope that it can drop a little more so that I can complete my planned position. However, it seems like the bull cannot wait any further. While we enjoy riding the uptrend, I will stay more cautious as the crypto assets have become one of our largest assets among all other holdings."))),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"I don\u2019t want to write anymore to distract the focus of this post.
