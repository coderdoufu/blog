When compared with other portfolio managers, this is pretty disappointing. When compared to portfolios that have a higher weightage on crypto, our portfolio's performance is still comparable. In June, why did I take a relatively large position in crypto? This is primarily because of short-term inflation hedges. There have been a lot of indicators (including CPI) pointing to inflation surges in recent months (tapering) from the Fed. I expect the money to flow into crypto assets or commodities. Further on-chain analysis has also shown that many leveraged positions have been washed out during the market capitulation, meaning that crypto traders are now holding as opposed to trading.

Its DRAM and NAND prices might still rise due to the strong end-market demand. In terms of PLTR, it is still overpriced (based on traditional valuation methods).
