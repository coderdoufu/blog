Further reading of sports articles can be accomplished in several different ways. To do this, you can leave the website and search on Google. Another option is to search the relevant articles on the same website. While both methods require you to search for relevant articles, neither guarantees you will be able to locate an article you want to read. How can the system help you by recommending relevant articles so that you don't have to search for them? Content recommendation is the answer. Based on the time and device that you are using right now, an algorithm can recommend content that you would be interested in reading. For instance, if you use 4G instead of a wi-fi connection on your smartphone, the algorithm is unlikely to recommend video content and will likely recommend shorter and more relevant articles instead. You might be an avid sports fan, for example, and you enjoy reading articles about Cristiano Ronaldo. Thus, the algorithm can map your interest precisely and recommend articles related to football."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Businesses can benefit from content recommendations by increasing sales and developing new products.

You will also see ratings, product categories, and other technical details about the products. As we build a profile for the product in our recommendation system, we find this information extremely valuable. Next, we will create the model. Detailed information about these models will be covered in separate articles. Your model will begin collecting feedback as soon as it starts serving customers. Generally, this is done through AB testing, where multiple deployed models are compared at the same time, and whichever generates the highest Click Through Rate (CTR) (the criteria will vary according to the business scenario) is considered the winner.
