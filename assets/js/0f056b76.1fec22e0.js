As a result of this and the announcement that ARK is buying 5.6 million Palantir shares across its actively managed exchange-traded funds, Palantir's share price continued to rise. I have explained previously that Palantir is a unique data analytic company that has won unprecedented government trust. Due to its special relationship with the US government, Palantir is expected to hold the top spot for providing intelligence to the US government for a long time to come, similar to Boeing in the US market. In turn, this also means that allies will continue to depend on Palantir for their intelligence needs. Among the most famous names in Silicon Valley, Palantir has signed deals with IBM, Amazon, and Fujitsu. During Q2 of the company's fiscal year, sales to customers in the U.S. grew by more than 28% year-over-year. Given that it is a fast-growing business with sticky government contracts, I believe its current stock price does not truly reflect its future value (high growth companies typically trade at a premium to their book values)."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"china-market"},"China market"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"People are obviously concerned about China right now.

Market players worry about the situation after People's Daily called for more scrutiny of the sector, which was worth 54.5 billion yuan (US$8.4 billion) and will reach 63.6 billion yuan this year. China's regulatory crackdown has put a lot of pressure on its share price, just as it has on Chinese tech stocks.
