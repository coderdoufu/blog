Second, $0968.HK (Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd) and Byd will be added to Hang Seng Index. This undoubtedly improves their visibility to a broader range of investors and the index inclusion effect will also increase their stock rating indirectly. Third, Meituan, one of our largest holdings, has reported excellent financial results. At the same time, CEO Wang Xing has also revealed that the company is working with regulators to make the appropriate changes to its business.

Many analyses have shown that this temporary crash was a healthy correction that wiped out many leveraged positions. Big whales have shown interest in buying more on the dip and this created stronger support for the next big wave up. The technical analysis has saved us from selling at the bottom and helped us build back our crypto positions at a better price level.
